        When 2 nodes have equivalent priorities, they are rendered merged in the header, if both of them exist for a physical device.
        - They usually have shared features that are rendered, if thats not the case, a render error occurs, and the device with a higher priority is rendered
        -->
        <!--
        Having equivalent priorities doesn't mean they are equal.
        - Depending on the order of the priority list (lowest to highest/highest to lowest), the element holding the priorityEquivelantTo atribute might be of higher/lower priority than the element its referencing
        - In this case, the element with the higher priority is used as fallback for render errors
        - Additionally, the contributors of the element wit the higher priority are shown first
