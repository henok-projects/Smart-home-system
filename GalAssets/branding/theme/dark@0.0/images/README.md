# Images and resolution
- Each image that would be used is a leaf in the directory tree.
- It has a name that describes the unique key of the image, and containes image files of 1x, 2x, and 3x resolutions.
- The image files are named '1x', '2x', 3x' followed by the image format (png, jpeg, ..)
- An image doesn't need to provide all three sizes, Galsie fallbacks to the nearest available resolution
