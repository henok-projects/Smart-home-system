Downloaded from https://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/

The naming on figma didn't match that of the downloaded font, so the downlaoded font was renamed as such:
hairline -> thin
thin -> extra light
light -> light

# NOTE
Used Lato-Latin since it only includes necessary latin characters and as a result file size is smaller

# Note
- BrandFontWeight defines the set of weights (thin, extra light, light, regular, medium, semibold, bold, extra bold, heavy) and for each the their respective filenames.
- This means that any added font must have all those files and the filenames cant be changed without updating the app
